# Python Comments
1. Comments can be used to explain Python code. 
2. Comments can be used to make the code more readable. 
3. Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

## Creating a comment
Comments start with a '#', and Python will ignore them:
```python
# Single-line comment
print("Hello World!")
```

In case of multiple-line comment, you can use triple quotes
```python
"""
Multiple line comment
...
...
"""
print("Hello World!")
```

**Note**: We can achieve multi-line comments by using single triple quotes or by double triple quotes
