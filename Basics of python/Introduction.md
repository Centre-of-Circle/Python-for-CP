# Introduction to Python
Python is an easy-to-learn and powerful Object-Oriented Programming language. It is a high-level programming language.

## Why Python?
1. Easy to Use: Python is comparatively an easier-to-use language as compared to other programming languages.
2. Expressive Language: The syntax of Python is closer to how you would write pseudocode. It can express the code's purpose better than many other languages.
3. Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language; this means that the Python installation interprets and executes the code a line at a time.
4. Python is one of the most popular programming languages to be used in Web Development owing to the variety of Web Development platforms built over it like Django, Flask, etc.

### It is used for:
+ web development (server-side),
+ software development,
+ mathematics,
+ system scripting.

## Why Python?
+ Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
+ Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
+ Python has a syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
+ Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
+ Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way, or a functional way.

## Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
+ Python was designed for readability and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
+ Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
+ Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions, and classes. Other programming languages often use curly brackets for this purpose.
