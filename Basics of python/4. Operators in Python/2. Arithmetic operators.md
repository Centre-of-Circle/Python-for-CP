Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

| Operator | Description                                                                             | Syntax |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| +        | Addition: adds two number                                                                | x+y     |
| \-       | Substraction: substracts two number                                                      | x-y     |
| \*       | Multiplication: multiplies two number                                                    | x*y     |
| /        | Division(float): divides the 1st number by the 2nd one                                   | x/y     |
| //       | Division(floor): divides the 1st number by the 2nd one but returns the integer part only | x//y    |
| %        | Modulus: returns the reminder when 1st number is divided by the 2nd one                  | x%y     |
| \*\*     | Power: returns 1st raised to the power 2nd                                               | x**y   |

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
