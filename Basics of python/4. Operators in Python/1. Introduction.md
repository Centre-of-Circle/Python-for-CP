# Introduction to Operators
Operators are used to performing operations on variables and values.
In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
Example:
```python
print (10 + 5)
```
Python divides the operators into the following groups:

+ Arithmetic operators
+ Assignment operators
+ Comparison operators
+ Logical operators
+ Identity operators
+ Membership operators
+ Bitwise operators
