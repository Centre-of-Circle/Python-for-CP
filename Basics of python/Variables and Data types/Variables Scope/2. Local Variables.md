## Local Scpoes :
The variables which are defined inside a function body have a local scope. This implies that local variables can be accessed only inside the function in which they are declared.
## Creating a local variable 
We declare a local variable inside a function. Consider the given function definition:
```python
def func():
  username = "Cpsbd66"
  print(username)
func()
```

We get the output as:
```
Cpsbd66
```

## Accessing A Local Variable Outside The Scope
```python
def func():
  username = "Cpsbd66"
func()
print(name)
```

In the above code, we declared a local variable y inside the function func(), and then we tried to access it from outside the function. We get the output as:
```
NameError: name 'username' is not defined
```
We get an error because the lifetime of a local variable is the function it is defined in.
Outside the function, the variable does not exist and cannot be accessed. In other words, a variable cannot be accessed outside its scope.

## The Lifetime of a Variable
The time for which the variable exists in memory is called the lifetime of that variable:
- The lifetime of a Global variable is the entire program run (i.e., they live in the memory as long as the program is being executed).
- The lifetime of a Local variable is their function's run (i.e., as long as their function is being executed).
